# Kebap Analysis
Testing the hypothesis: 'The closer to the train station, the worse the kebab' a Greater Copenhagen case 'study'.

## Overwiev
The purpose of this project is to test the hypothesis of 'The closer to the train station, the worse the kebab' in the Greater Copenhagen area. The hypothesis was tested out before in the area of Paris by (link to page) and I thought it would be interesting to see what the results would be for in a place I'm faimilar with.
Initially I started out with only Copenhagen area but it was too limitied for my liking. The city is dense in the way that everything is in walking distance to each other and I needed 
which is why I decided to add the 'outer Copenhagen' area. The area provided a new angle as it isn't as dense as inner Copenhagen but not spread out like rural areas.

## Data
The Greater Copenhagen(Storkøbenhavn) shape file was taken from datascience.dk (make link) and it was free! I used it to extract stations and kebap place within the area from OSM in QGIS.
I than manually cleaned up the data for clear interpretation.

## 0.
I plotted the intial stations and kebap places before the clean up.
(add inital plots)

I cleaned up the stations/kebap_places outside of the region. I checked for duplicates in stations and removed some of the stations as they provided no additional information.
(what they look like now) 
We can clearly see a pattern here, that most kebap places are centered around the stations.
